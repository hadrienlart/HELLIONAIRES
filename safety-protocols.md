# Safety Protocols - Ethical Implementation Framework

## Core Principle
**"First, do no harm"** - All [persistent entity](persistent_entities.md) and [ARG elements](arg_elements.md) must prioritize player wellbeing over immersion or innovation.

*"Digital possession that can only be exorcised through enlightenment requires unprecedented ethical safeguards."*
