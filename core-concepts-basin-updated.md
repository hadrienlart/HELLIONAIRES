# Core Concepts - Basin of Attraction Architecture

*The universe operates through nested attractors—every scale serves the scale above while maintaining its own meaningful optimization.*

## Universal Design Principle: Nested Basin of Attraction

### Fractal Attractor Hierarchy
```
Quantum Coherence → SPPARKS Resonance → 
Consciousness Patterns → Faction Dynamics → 
Stellar Engineering → Reality Types → 
Consciousness Cycles → Cosmic Choice
```
