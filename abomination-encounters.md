# Abomination Encounters: Game Mechanics Design

## Core Design Philosophy
Abomination encounters scale with player understanding, transforming from traditional FPS combat to existential horror experiences. Each entity type requires different mechanical approaches based on the player's tier progression and cosmic awareness.

*"The more you understand what you're fighting, the more you realize you might be fighting yourself."*
