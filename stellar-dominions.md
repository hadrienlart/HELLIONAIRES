# Stellar Dominions

## Core Concept
Territories controlled by individual [Hellionaires](hellionaires.md), ranging from single star systems to vast galactic regions. Governance styles vary dramatically based on cosmic location, available resources, and individual personality of the ruling entity.

*"The difference between cosmic rulers is as vast as the space between their stars."*
