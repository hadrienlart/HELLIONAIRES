# Reality Architects

## Core Identity
Brave and possibly insane individuals who venture into [Fractured Zones](fractured-zones.md) to understand reality's nature. Pioneers of hybrid technology combining [SPPARKS](spparks-system.md) and [TAI](tai-overview.md) systems, pushing boundaries of existence, metaphysics, and consciousness.

*"We reject the binary choice. Reality is large enough for synthesis."*
