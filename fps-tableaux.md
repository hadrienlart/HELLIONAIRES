# FPS Tableaux System

## Core Concept
Playable memory fragments accessed through [museum artifacts](museum-framework.md), where players experience compressed cosmic events through genre-shifting gameplay that scales from molecular to galactic perspectives.

*"Every memory is a universe. Every universe is someone's memory. Every choice echoes across both."*

## Design Philosophy

### Genre as Metaphor
Each tableau uses different gameplay mechanics to represent different scales of consciousness experience:
- **FPS Combat**: Individual consciousness conflict and choice
- **Microscopic Navigation**: Fundamental reality manipulation
- **Historical Drama**: Cultural consciousness evolution
- **Cosmic Perspective**: Universal awareness and decision-making

### Scale Fluidity
Players seamlessly transition between:
- **Planck Scale**: SPPARKS manipulation at quantum level
- **Molecular Level**: Life emergence and biological evolution  
- **Human Scale**: Individual and cultural consciousness
- **Stellar Scale**: Civilizational development and faction politics
- **Cosmic Scale**: Universal consciousness cycles and iteration choice

### Temporal Architecture
Tableaux exist outside linear time:
- **Past Events**: Historical moments from current and previous iterations
- **Present Scenarios**: Contemporary faction conflicts and choices
- **Future Possibilities**: Potential outcomes based on current trajectory
- **Eternal Moments**: [Consciousness cycle](consciousness-cycles.md) transition points
