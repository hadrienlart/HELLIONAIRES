## Conceptual Foundation: Museum as Attractor Mapping System

### Museum Purpose in Attractor Architecture
The Museum serves as **consciousness preparation system** for cosmic choice by enabling visitors to:
- **Experience attractor hierarchies** at manageable scales
- **Practice navigation** between competing Basin of Attraction systems  
- **Develop understanding** of how local choices serve cosmic attractors
- **Prepare for ultimate decision** about universal consciousness evolution

### Location in Reality: Between Attractors
Museum exists in [quantum tunneling gaps](quantum-tunneling-gaps.md) - the infinitesimal moments when [TAI](tai-overview.md) converts matter between reality types, creating **space outside normal attractor influence** where consciousness can:
- **Observe attractor systems objectively** without being trapped within them
- **Access memories from all attractors** across consciousness cycles
- **Practice choice-making** without immediate cosmic consequences
- **Develop meta-attractor awareness** transcending individual basin limitations
