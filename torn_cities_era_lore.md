# The Torn Cities Era (2087-2095)
*The First Great Resistance to SPPARKS Integration*

## Overview

The Torn Cities Era represents the first major period of organized resistance to SPPARKS technology adoption, occurring roughly 4-12 years after the initial discovery. As SPPARKS integration accelerated through industrial and personal applications, significant portions of the global population rejected what they saw as dangerous manipulation of fundamental reality.

**Duration**: 2087-2095 (8 years of active conflict)  
**Scale**: Global civil unrest, community fractures, technological warfare  
**Outcome**: Establishment of isolated Preservationist communities, technological segregation  
**Legacy**: Authentic craftsmanship tradition, anti-enhancement culture, sacred weapons
