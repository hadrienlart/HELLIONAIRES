# Fractured Zones

## Core Concept
Regions where [TAI's](tai-overview.md) reality conversion process failed or was interrupted, creating unstable areas where [SPPARKS](spparks-system.md) and synthetic physics exist simultaneously. Discovered unexpectedly - neither [TAI](tai-overview.md) nor any faction anticipated their emergence.

*"Reality itself is broken here. The rules are negotiable."*

## Visual Manifestation

### Broken Reflection Phenomenon
- **Faceted Reality**: World appears through broken mirror-like fragments
- **Wrong Refraction**: Light behaves according to impossible optical rules
- **Broken Parallax**: Distance and position perception completely unreliable
- **Angular Distortion**: Movement creates disorienting visual feedback
- **Perspective Chaos**: Objects appear closer/farther than actual position

### Atmospheric Effects
- **Light Speed Variation**: Photons travel at inconsistent velocities
- **Atmospheric Adaptation**: Environment struggles to maintain coherent physics
- **Color Spectrum Shift**: Visual representation beyond normal 400-700nm wavelengths
- **Chromatic Anomalies**: Colors that shouldn't exist in normal reality
- **Luminosity Fluctuation**: Brightness levels shift unpredictably

### Shader Requirements
- **Spectral Extension**: Visual effects representing expanded color perception
- **Scary/Exciting Balance**: Simultaneously frightening and fascinating visual design
- **Reality Glitch Effects**: Rendering errors that appear intentional
- **Parallax Distortion**: Camera movement creating impossible perspective shifts
- **Chromatic Aberration**: Color separation effects suggesting broken optics

## Physics Properties

### Hybrid Matter States
- **[SPPARKS](spparks-system.md)/Synthetic Fusion**: Matter exhibiting properties of both systems
- **Probability Solids**: Objects existing in multiple states simultaneously
- **Quantum Liquids**: Fluids with consciousness-responsive behavior
- **Reality Gases**: Atmospheric substances that alter local physics
