# Weapons & Equipment - Kill Switch Arsenal

*The role is eternal; the vessel is temporary*

---

## Core Philosophy

**The Kill Switch remains constant across:**
- **Vessels**: Different humans throughout iterations
- **Eras**: From early SPPARKS discovery to cosmic transcendence
- **Locations**: Museum, tableaux, fractured zones, multiple realities
- **Scales**: Planck manipulation to galactic engineering

**The weapons must be universally scalable, era-independent, and vessel-agnostic.**
