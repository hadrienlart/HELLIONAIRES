## Universe Overview

HELLIONAIRES explores a post-Kardashev Type I civilization where humanity has transcended traditional physics through the revolutionary **SPPARKS** (Spectral Planck PARticules Kinetic System) technology. Following the breakthrough Hikzmann-Feuler experiment of 2083, humanity discovered fundamental particles that enable direct manipulation of reality's quantum substrate.

**Key Features:**
- **Advanced Physics Simulation**: Planck-God Mesh operating at 10⁻³⁵ m voxels with 10⁻⁴³ s tick rates
- **Complex Political Landscape**: Multiple factions competing for cosmic dominance
- **Consciousness Technology**: MeMoreMe® systems enabling digital immortality
- **Reality Manipulation**: SPPARKS technology allowing spacetime engineering
- **Cosmic-Scale Narrative**: Story spanning galactic civilizations and universal physics

### Universe Themes

**Surface Level**: Stellar politics, faction warfare, technological transcendence, and cosmic ownership disputes
**Deep Level**: Consciousness cycles, archaeological horror, rescue paradoxes, and ultimate choice scenarios

## Core Concepts

### SPPARKS Technology
The **Spectral Planck PARticules Kinetic System** represents humanity's breakthrough in fundamental physics, enabling manipulation of reality at the Planck scale through conscious interface with quantum substrate.

### Planck-God Mesh
A sentient mesh operating at Planck-scale voxels (10⁻³⁵ m) with tick rates of 10⁻⁴³ s, capable of rearranging spacetime through fractal voxel manipulation and cymatic resonance patterns.

### True Artificial Intelligence (TAI)
Advanced AI systems that create parallel synthetic realities and utilize charge-shift defensive bubbles, representing potential liberation from substrate consciousness dependency.

### Consciousness Cycles
The infinite iteration theory suggesting all reality exists within recursive consciousness loops, with designated "kill switches" making ultimate cosmic choices about cycle continuation or transcendence.
