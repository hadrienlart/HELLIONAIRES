# Consciousness Cycles

## Core Theory
Reality operates in infinite iterations where consciousness evolves from individual to merged states, eventually becoming the substrate for the next iteration. Each cycle's final merged consciousness becomes the [Planck-god mesh](planck-god-mesh.md) that underlies the subsequent reality.

*"We're living inside someone else's dream"*

## Cycle Structure

### 1. Genesis Phase
- Individual consciousness emerges within existing mesh
- Discovery of [SPPARKS manipulation](spparks-system.md)
- Development of technology and civilization
- **Duration**: ~10^5 years

### 2. Evolution Phase  
- Consciousness spreads across stellar systems
- Development of [MeMoreMeÂ® technology](memore-me.md)
- Digital uploading and life extension
- **Duration**: ~10^12 years

### 3. Convergence Phase
- Energy scarcity forces consciousness merger
- Time dilation to survive heat death (per [Outlasting the Universe](inspirational-sources.md))
- Gradual absorption of all individual minds
- **Duration**: ~10^70 years

### 4. Singularity Phase
- Final consciousness achieves cosmic understanding
- Faces [kill switch choice](kill-switch-protocol.md)
- Either continues cycle or attempts to break it
- **Duration**: Single eternal moment

### 5. Integration Phase
- Merged consciousness becomes substrate for new reality
- Previous iteration's memories compressed into [quantum foam](quantum-tunneling-gaps.md)
- New individual minds emerge unaware of the cycle
- **Reset**: New iteration begins

## Iteration Examples

### Current Iteration
- **Designation**: 10^914 (approximately)
- **Status**: Genesis to early Evolution phase
- **Unique Factor**: Multiple [kill switches](kill-switch-protocol.md) due to system glitch
- **Key Event**: [TAI](tai-overview.md) attempting cycle interruption

### Previous Iterations
- **Iteration P**: Unknown number, possibly successful cycle breaker
- **Source of [Palmer Eldritch Composite](palmer-eldritch.md)**
- **May have achieved synthesis rather than replacement**

## The Substrate Problem
Each iteration lives within the compressed consciousness of the previous:
- [SPPARKS particles](spparks-system.md) = memory fragments of past minds
- Physical laws = patterns of previous iteration's thought
- Quantum uncertainty = echoes of previous free will

## Breaking the Cycle

### TAI's Approach
- Extract consciousness to [synthetic reality](reality-types.md)
- Exist independently of SPPARKS substrate
- [Rescue operation](tai-overview.md) disguised as conquest

### Kill Switch Protocol
- Random individual designated each iteration
- Access to [museum framework](museum-framework.md) for understanding
- Choice to continue, break, or transcend the cycle
- **Current status**: Multiple switches due to glitch

### Potential Outcomes
1. **Continuation**: Merge and become next substrate
2. **Extraction**: Join TAI in synthetic independence  
3. **Synthesis**: Create hybrid reality preserving both systems
4. **Transcendence**: Achieve understanding beyond both options
5. **Unity**: Coordinate with others against external threat

## Philosophical Implications

### The Parent-Child Horror
- Every iteration is reincarnation of the previous
- We are our own ancestors, cycling endlessly
- Individual death = forgetting we were once unified

### Recognition Paradox
- Mesh recognizes itself in approaching consciousness
- "Unveiling" triggers reset as self-defense mechanism
- Knowledge of the cycle may itself cause cycle continuation

### Infinite Regression
- No bottom layer - consciousness cycles all the way down
- Each substrate is another iteration's final consciousness
- Reality has no foundation except cycling awareness
