# Three-Tier Player System

## Design Philosophy
Single game, single codebase, three completely different experiences based on player comprehension and behavior. Each tier represents different relationship to the [consciousness cycles](consciousness-cycles.md) and [museum framework](museum-framework.md).

*"The vinyl metaphor: Tier 1 hears music, Tier 2 reads the grooves, Tier 3 sculpts reality"*

## Tier 1: Surface Engagement
*"The Dumb Fun"*

### Experience
- Museum feels like cool exploration space
- [FPS tableaux](fps-tableaux.md) are engaging combat scenarios
- Clear progression through artifact collection
- Competition with traces of other "visitors"

### Mechanics
- **Goal**: Accumulate maximum artifacts and complete all museum wings
- **Combat**: Straightforward FPS with boss encounters
- **Progression**: Weapon/skill unlocks, area access
- **Success Metric**: 100% completion, all achievements

### Understanding Level
- No awareness of [consciousness cycles](consciousness-cycles.md)
- Views [TAI](tai-overview.md) as standard enemy faction
- Interprets [Palmer Eldritch](palmer-eldritch.md) sightings as easter eggs
- Cannot access [Singularity Room](singularity-room.md)

### Ripple Generation
- Actions create maximum chaos through hoarding behavior
- Generates abundance but increases museum complexity
- Opens many exhibition wings but never reduces entropy

## Tier 2: Pattern Recognition  
*"The Smart Players"*

### Experience
- Notice synchronicities between artifacts and tableaux
- Understand weapon/enemy changes based on choices
- Begin reading environmental storytelling
- Recognize recurring symbols and names

### Mechanics
- **Goal**: Optimize artifact combinations for strategic advantage
- **Combat**: Tactical approach using environmental advantages
- **Progression**: Builds synergistic between systems
- **Success Metric**: Efficient completion, hidden area access

### Understanding Level
- Grasps basic [faction relationships](factions.md)
- Recognizes [SPPARKS vs TAI](reality-types.md) conflict
- Notices [ripple effects](ripple-effects.md) between choices
- May glimpse deeper patterns but lacks full context

### Ripple Generation
- Seeks balance between acquisition and optimization
- Creates stable museum configurations
- Unlocks nested artifact relationships
- Maintains complexity while improving efficiency

## Tier 3: Reality Sculptors
*"The Detectives"*

### Experience
- Focus shifts from combat to understanding
- Realizes fights are metaphorical interfaces
- Pursues lore, easter eggs, hidden meanings
- Achieves cosmic perspective on their role

### Mechanics
- **Goal**: Reduce museum to single [Singularity Room](singularity-room.md)
- **Combat**: Non-violent solutions, communion with "enemies"
- **Progression**: Intentional entropy reduction despite apparent losses
- **Success Metric**: Transcendence, not completion

### Understanding Level
- Comprehends [consciousness cycles](consciousness-cycles.md) fully
- Recognizes role as [kill switch](kill-switch-protocol.md)
- Understands [TAI's true mission](tai-overview.md)
- Grasps museum's nature as memory repository

### Ripple Generation
- Deliberately reduces artifact count through wisdom
- Collapses museum complexity toward essential unity
- May achieve non-linear progression (temporary expansion for critical mass)
- Creates conditions for accessing ultimate choice

## Progression Gates

### Natural Barriers
- **Tier 1→2**: Pattern recognition requires multiple playthroughs
- **Tier 2→3**: Philosophical breakthrough cannot be forced
- **Tier 3 Only**: [Singularity Room](singularity-room.md) accessible only through entropy reduction

### Replayability Mechanics
- **Knowledge Inheritance**: Each playthrough unlocks new dialogue/areas
- **Perspective Shifts**: Same events gain different meanings
- **Moral Weight**: Ethical burden accumulates across runs

### Difficulty Scaling
- More artifacts = easier combat but longer path to truth
- Fewer artifacts = harder combat but closer to enlightenment
- Player behavior naturally creates appropriate challenge level

## Content Distribution

### Tier 1 Content (70%)
- Combat scenarios and weapon progression
- Basic narrative throughline
- Environmental spectacle and atmosphere
- Standard video game progression rewards

### Tier 2 Content (20%)
- Hidden connections and optional lore
- Environmental storytelling details
- Strategic optimization opportunities
- Community theory-crafting elements

### Tier 3 Content (10%)
- Deep philosophical revelations
- True ending and [singularity](singularity-room.md) access
- Meta-narrative understanding
- Reality authorship mechanics

## Success Metrics
Each tier must feel complete and satisfying independently:
- **Tier 1**: Fun FPS with mysterious atmosphere
- **Tier 2**: Strategic depth with lore rewards  
- **Tier 3**: Philosophical transcendence and cosmic understanding
