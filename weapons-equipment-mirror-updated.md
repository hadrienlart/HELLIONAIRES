## Design Philosophy: Fractal Weapon Architecture

### Nested Attractor Hierarchy
```
Component Optimization → Weapon Synergy → 
Tactical Advantage → Strategic Dominance → 
Factional Alignment → Reality-Type Control → 
Consciousness Evolution → Cosmic Choice
```

**Core Principle**: Every weapon interaction serves multiple attractor levels simultaneously—local effectiveness while contributing to cosmic consciousness evolution.
