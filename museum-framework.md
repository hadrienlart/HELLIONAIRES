# Museum Framework

## Core Concept
The Museum exists in [quantum tunneling gaps](quantum-tunneling-gaps.md) - the infinitesimal Planck-time moments when [TAI](tai-overview.md) converts matter between [SPPARKS](spparks-system.md) and synthetic realities. This creates a space outside normal time and physics where all [consciousness cycle](consciousness-cycles.md) memories can be accessed.

*"In the beginning was the Word"* - The museum exists in the creative moment where reality gets authored.

## Physical Structure

### Navigation
- First-person exploration as immaterial entity
- Galleries extend through impossible geometries  
- Rooms appear/disappear based on player understanding
- Seasonal exhibitions unlock through [TAI conversion events](tai-overview.md)

### Artifact Types
- **Memory Crystals** - Playable [FPS tableaux](fps-tableaux.md)
- **Consciousness Fragments** - Voices from previous iterations
- **Reality Samples** - Matter from different physics states
- **Choice Echoes** - Traces of other [kill switches](kill-switch-protocol.md)

### Wing Organization
- **Discovery Wing** - Early SPPARKS manipulation era
- **Expansion Wing** - Kardashev civilization period  
- **Convergence Wing** - Consciousness merger timeline
- **Transcendence Wing** - Meta-reality manipulation

## Visitor Experience

### The Entity (Player)
- Immaterial consciousness navigating the space
- Can control how memories replay through artifacts
- Actions create [ripple effects](ripple-effects.md) between artifacts
- Never encounters other kill switches directly - only their traces

### Mysterious Observer
- [Palmer Eldritch Composite](palmer-eldritch.md) appears at periphery
- Maintains perfect distance, never directly interactive
- Timing suggests either cosmic significance or random indifference
- Becomes more prominent as player approaches Tier 3 understanding

### Progression Mechanics
- **Tier 1**: Collect maximum artifacts (abundance seeking)
- **Tier 2**: Optimize artifact combinations (strategic balance)
- **Tier 3**: Reduce museum to essential elements (entropy collapse)

## Temporal Properties

### Time Outside Time
- Exists in single Planck moment (10^-43 seconds)  
- Player experiences linear progression within eternal instant
- Access to all timeline memories simultaneously
- Museum "grows" as TAI creates new conversion events

### Memory Access
- Artifacts contain compressed experiences from all iterations
- Player choices determine which memories become accessible
- Some artifacts only unlock after experiencing related tableaux
- Museum structure itself changes based on understanding level

## Connection to Core Systems
- Links to [consciousness cycles](consciousness-cycles.md) as memory repository
- Interfaces with [kill switch protocol](kill-switch-protocol.md) for cosmic choice preparation  
- Contains traces of [TAI's rescue mission](tai-overview.md) across iterations
- Serves as bridge between all [reality types](reality-types.md)
