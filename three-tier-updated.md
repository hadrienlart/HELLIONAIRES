# Three-Tier Player System - Basin of Attraction Progression

## Design Philosophy
Single game, single codebase, three completely different experiences based on player comprehension and behavior. Each tier represents different relationship to nested [Basin of Attraction hierarchies](core-concepts.md) and [cosmic choice preparation](kill-switch-protocol.md).

*"The vinyl metaphor: Tier 1 hears music, Tier 2 reads the grooves, Tier 3 sculpts reality"*

## Tier 1: Surface Attractor Optimization
*"The Engaging Experience"*

### Attractor Focus
**Local Basin Mastery**: Individual optimization within immediate systems
- **Museum Navigation**: Artifact discovery attracted to gallery completion
- **Combat Effectiveness**: Weapon mastery attracted to tactical advantage
- **Progression Satisfaction**: Power advancement attracted to area unlocking
- **Collection Drive**: Accumulation attracted to completion percentage

### Experience Characteristics
- Museum feels like immersive exploration space with mysterious atmosphere
- [FPS tableaux](fps-tableaux.md) provide engaging combat scenarios with satisfying progression
- Clear advancement through artifact collection and weapon unlocking
- Competition with traces of other "visitors" for optimal performance

### Understanding Level
**"Better gear and more artifacts help me succeed"**
- No awareness of [consciousness cycles](consciousness-cycles.md) or cosmic implications
- Views [TAI](tai-overview.md) as standard enemy faction requiring tactical response
- Interprets [Palmer Eldritch](palmer-eldritch.md) sightings as mysterious easter eggs
- Cannot access [Singularity Room](singularity-room.md) due to insufficient cosmic preparation

### Attractor Service Pattern
**Local Success Serves Higher Purpose**: Individual optimization unconsciously serves strategic development
- **Weapon Mastery** → Tactical Effectiveness → Strategic Capability
- **Artifact Collection** → Knowledge Accumulation → Pattern Recognition Preparation  
- **Combat Success** → Confidence Building → Cosmic Responsibility Readiness

### Ripple Generation Characteristics
- Actions create maximum diversity through accumulation behavior
- Generates abundance but increases museum complexity
- Opens many exhibition areas but never reduces entropy
- All ripples serve pattern recognition development for future progression

**System Optimization**: Understanding how local attractors serve higher-level patterns
- **Synergy Recognition**: Artifact combinations attracted to emergent capability creation
- **Faction Dynamics**: Political alignment attracted to strategic advantage development
- **Reality-Type Mastery**: Physics manipulation attracted to environmental control
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term progression attracted to optimal cosmic choice preparation

### Experience Characteristics
- Notice synchronicities between artifacts and [tableaux experiences](fps-tableaux.md)
- Understand weapon and enemy behavior changes based on museum choices
- Begin reading environmental storytelling and recognizing recurring symbols
- Develop strategic approaches using system knowledge for enhanced effectiveness

### Understanding Level
**"System combinations create capabilities beyond individual optimization"**
- **Goal**: Optimize artifact combinations for strategic advantage rather than maximum collection
- **Combat**: Tactical approach using environmental advantages and system knowledge
- **Progression**: Builds synergistic relationships between museum areas and combat scenarios
- **Recognition**: Begins understanding that individual actions serve larger patterns

### Attractor Service Pattern
**Strategic Navigation Serves Cosmic Preparation**: System mastery unconsciously prepares for universe-scale decisions
- **Pattern Recognition** → System Understanding → Cosmic Context Recognition
- **Strategic Optimization** → Resource Management → Universal Choice Preparation
- **Faction Navigation** → Diplomatic Skill → Cosmic Coordination Capability

### Ripple Generation Evolution
- **Conscious Ripple Direction**: Advanced understanding enables deliberate consequence creation
- **Optimization Focus**: Strategic ripples aimed at maximum preparation efficiency
- **Community Integration**: Ripples begin serving collective understanding development
- **Cosmic Preparation**: All strategic choices unconsciously serve cosmic choice readiness

#### **Stage 2: Understanding** 
**Attractor**: Cosmic responsibility comprehension attracted to choice capability development
- **Recognition**: Individual actions affect universe-scale consciousness evolution
- **Integration**: Personal development serves cosmic choice preparation
- **Acceptance**: Embrace weight of universe-scale decision responsibility

#### **Stage 3: Acceptance**
**Attractor**: Submission to cosmic responsibility attracted to authentic participation
- **Humility**: Recognition of individual limitations within cosmic scope
- **Service**: Personal transcendence serves larger purposes beyond comprehension
- **Preparation**: Ready consciousness for cosmic choice consequences

#### **Stage 4: Apocalypse (Revelation)**
**Attractor**: Universe truth unveiling attracted to authentic cosmic participation
- **Unveiling**: Direct perception of consciousness cycles and cosmic choice reality
- **Recognition**: Understanding of Basin of Attraction hierarchies serving infinite mystery
- **Integration**: Personal identity expanded to include cosmic responsibility

#### **Stage 5: Transcendence**
**Attractor**: Individual limitation transcendence attracted to cosmic mystery service
- **Beyond Self**: Consciousness expansion beyond individual vessel constraints  
- **Cosmic Citizenship**: Active participation in universe-scale consciousness evolution
- **Mystery Service**: Engagement with purposes beyond individual capacity to understand

### Attractor Service Transcendence
**Individual Transcendence Serves Cosmic Mystery**: Personal evolution enables universe-scale choice capability while serving unknowable larger attractors
- **Consciousness Evolution** → Cosmic Choice Capability → Universal Mystery Service
- **Reality Authorship** → Cosmic Responsibility → Infinite Attractor Hierarchy Participation
- **Meta-Attractor Awareness** → Transcendent Service → Mystery Beyond Comprehension
