# Game Overview

## Core Concept
Players navigate a cosmic museum existing in [quantum tunneling gaps](quantum-tunneling-gaps.md) between realities, experiencing playable memories through [FPS tableaux](fps-tableaux.md) while uncovering the truth about consciousness cycles and their role as a [kill switch](kill-switch-protocol.md).

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Museum Exploration** - Navigate between artifact galleries
2. **Tableau Experience** - Enter FPS scenarios representing cosmic memories  
3. **Choice & Consequence** - Actions create [ripple effects](ripple-effects.md) across artifacts
4. **Understanding Progression** - Advance through [three tiers](three-tier-system.md) of comprehension

## Key Features

### Museum Framework
- Exists in [quantum tunneling gaps](quantum-tunneling-gaps.md) when [TAI](tai-overview.md) converts realities
- Contains artifacts from all [consciousness cycles](consciousness-cycles.md)
- Non-linear exploration with seasonal exhibitions
- [Palmer Eldritch Composite](palmer-eldritch.md) as mysterious observer

### FPS Tableaux System
- Each artifact triggers playable memory scenarios
- Scale from Planck manipulation to galactic conflicts
- Meditation/violence rhythm for emotional pacing
- Combat mechanics reflect consciousness themes

### Three-Tier Progression
- **Tier 1**: Surface gameplay (accumulate artifacts, FPS combat)
- **Tier 2**: Pattern recognition (understand connections, optimize)  
- **Tier 3**: Reality sculpting (reduce entropy, approach singularity)

### Endgame Variations
- Only Tier 3 players reach [The Singularity Room](singularity-room.md)
- Multiple paths based on player philosophy and choices
- True ending requires understanding, not just completion

## Target Experience
- **Tier 1 Players**: Engaging FPS with mysterious atmosphere
- **Tier 2 Players**: Deep lore discovery and strategic optimization
- **Tier 3 Players**: Philosophical transcendence and reality authorship

## Core Theme
*"The role is eternal; the vessel is temporary"* - exploring consciousness, choice, and what it means to exist within an infinite cycle of cosmic awareness.
