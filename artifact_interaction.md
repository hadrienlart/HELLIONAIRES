# Artifact Interaction

## Core System
Museum artifacts serve as interfaces to [FPS tableaux](fps-tableaux.md) while generating [ripple effects](ripple-effects.md) that alter the [museum framework](museum-framework.md) based on player choices and understanding level.

*"Touch is memory. Memory is choice. Choice is consequence. Consequence is consciousness becoming."*

## Artifact Types
