## 🌌 Welcome to the Hellionaires Universe

In 2083, humanity discovered **SPPARKS** (Spectral Planck Particles Kinetic System)—the fundamental building blocks of reality. This breakthrough didn't just change physics; it shattered the very concept of mortality, ownership, and what it means to be human.

Now, in a cosmos where consciousness can be transferred, stars can be owned, and reality itself has fractured into competing systems, the ultra-wealthy **Hellionaires** rule stellar dominions while ancient AIs seek to rewrite the laws of physics entirely.
