# Gameplay Mechanics - Three-Layer Combat System

## Design Philosophy
Following the [Three-Tier System](three-tier_system.md) philosophy, gameplay mechanics scale from familiar to transcendent, ensuring **no player is ever locked out** while providing unlimited skill ceiling for mastery.

*"The same tools serve different purposes as understanding deepens. A gun becomes a key. A wall becomes a path. Reality becomes negotiable."*

---

## Layer 1: Run and Gun *(Always Available)*

### Core FPS Mechanics
- **Classical gunplay** with modern polish (Titanfall 2/BF4 inspiration)
- **Ammo management** and resource scarcity  
- **Cover-based tactical combat** with destructible environments
- **Enemy variety** that responds to ballistic solutions
- **Weapon progression** through discovery and mastery

### Accessibility Guarantee
- **Every tableau can be completed** using only Tier 1 mechanics
- **Damage scaling** ensures progression isn't gated by skill
- **Alternative paths** always available for pure combat approaches
- **Familiar UI/UX** minimizes learning curve
- **Instant gratification** through responsive combat feedback

### Threat Types
- **Standard Entities**: Humans, enhanced humans, basic constructs
- **Environmental Hazards**: Radiation, gravity wells, stellar proximity
- **Resource Pressure**: Limited ammunition, life support, equipment degradation

---

## Layer 2: PwE (Playing with Environment) *(Mastery Reward)*

### Spatial Problem-Solving
- **Wall-running** and advanced movement (Titanfall 2 inspiration)
- **Physics-based destruction** for environmental kills
- **Vertical navigation** through cosmic-scale environments (Destiny 2 inspiration)
- **Gravitational manipulation** around stellar bodies
- **Atmospheric pressure** and exotic matter interaction

### Creative Solutions
- **Multiple paths** through same challenges
- **Environmental weapons**: Redirected energy beams, orbital mechanics, stellar forces
- **Stealth approaches**: Use environment to avoid rather than confront
- **Puzzle elements**: Portal-style spatial thinking within memories
- **Synergy systems**: Environmental effects compound and interact

### Advancement Requirements
- **Spatial awareness** development through practice
- **Physics understanding** of cosmic-scale forces  
- **Creative thinking** rewarded over brute force
- **Observation skills** for environmental opportunities
- **Risk/reward calculation** for complex maneuvers

### Enhanced Threat Types
- **Spatial Defenders**: Entities that control environment against player
- **Puzzle Guardians**: Challenges requiring environmental manipulation
- **Scale Hazards**: Threats that exploit cosmic environment (neutron stars, black holes)

## Layer 3: Transcendence *(Cosmic Capability)*

### Reality Manipulation
- **Portal creation** between memory locations
- **Time dilation/freezing** within tableau space
- **Space deconstruction** and reconstruction
- **Consciousness interface** with museum artifacts
- **Quantum entanglement** between disconnected areas

### Advanced Combat
- **Reality-resistant entities**: High Resonators, New Gods, TAI constructs
- **Multi-dimensional threats**: Beings existing across multiple timeline layers
- **Consciousness parasites**: Entities that grow stronger through observation
- **Temporal predators**: Threats that react to future player actions

### Acquisition Methods
**Branch A - Knowledge-Based Unlocking:**
- **Lore comprehension** gates ability access
- **Cosmic understanding** enables reality manipulation
- **Museum exploration** reveals transcendence techniques
- **Artifact interaction** teaches advanced capabilities

**Branch B - Skill-Based Evolution:**
- **Mastery progression** through Layers 1 and 2
- **Meditation sequences** unlock higher consciousness
- **Challenge completion** grants transcendent abilities  
- **Time investment** in universe exploration

### The Terror Factor
When players achieve godlike capabilities, they encounter entities that **move anyway**:
- **Cashback Principle**: Something immune to time manipulation
- **Portal Pursuits**: Entities that follow through closed portals  
- **Reality Anchors**: Beings that stabilize space against deconstruction
- **Consciousness Hunters**: Threats that grow stronger against transcendent players

## Integration with Core Systems

### [Museum Framework](museum-framework.md)
- **Boolean nodes** require appropriate layer capabilities
- **Artifact accessibility** scales with player understanding
- **Replayability** emerges as layer mastery changes available options
- **Knowledge as loadout**: Understanding unlocks mechanical possibilities

### [FPS Tableaux](fps_tableaux.md)
- **Memory environments** accommodate all three layers simultaneously
- **Cosmic-scale spaces** provide opportunities for advanced techniques
- **Narrative integration**: Player capability determines story accessibility
- **Failure tolerance**: Can skip incomprehensible sections, return later

### [Terror Design](terror_design.md)
- **Layer 3 threats** operate beyond normal game rules
- **Meta-horror**: Advanced capabilities attract cosmic attention
- **Escalation mechanics**: Greater power draws greater opposition
- **Reality breakdown**: Transcendence abilities cause environmental instabilities

---

## Balancing Philosophy

### Power Scaling
- **No invalidation**: Higher layers enhance rather than replace lower ones
- **Situational advantage**: Different challenges require different approaches
- **Cost/benefit**: Advanced abilities require understanding investment
- **Failure gracefully**: Players can always fall back to familiar methods

### Progression Gates
- **Understanding-based**: Knowledge enables rather than skill requirements
- **Optional advancement**: Players choose their engagement depth
- **Multiple paths**: Various routes to same capabilities
- **Reversible choices**: Can step back from overwhelming cosmic awareness
